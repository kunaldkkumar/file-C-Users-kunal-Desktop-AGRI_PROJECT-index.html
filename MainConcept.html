                  <p><big><u><b>Types of Soil and Suitable Crops </big></u></b></p>
	<p><b>The soil is one of the important resources of our country, as the fertile soil helps us in producing many crops. This serves the food requirements not only within the country but also in other parts of the world. Although it is not the same at every place on the earth. The types of soil of a place are determined by climate, landscape, and vegetation of that place. Soil also depends on the time of its formation.</b></p><br>	
                    <p><big><u><b>Types of Soil</big></u></b></p>
                    <h2>Types of Soil</h2>
<p>There are different types of soil. They are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><b><big>Sandy Soil</big></b></li><br>
<li><b><big>Clayey Soil</big></b></li><br>
<li><b><big>Loamy Soil</big></b></li><br>
<li><b><big>Black Soil</big></b></li><br>
<li><b><big>Red Soil</big></b></li><br>
</ol>
<h2>Soil Classification on the Based on Particles Size</h2>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>1. Sandy soil</strong></span></h3>
<p>Sandy soil contains more than 60% sand and clay. It contains very little clay and silt, so it is porous. The size of soil particles in sandy soil is from 0.2mm to 2.0mm. The water building capacity of a sandy soil is very poor. Hence, there is a lot of air present in this type of soil.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8634" src="https://d1whtlypfis84e.cloudfront.net/guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/19080552/p52.png" alt="types of soil - sandy soil" width="347" height="230" /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Suitable Crops: Sandy soil is not good for plants. However, melon and coconut grow in sandy soil. If water is available for irrigation then crops such as maize, millets, barley can be grown in desert soil. Cactus also grows in this soil.</b></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2. Clayey Soil</strong></h3>
<p>The clayey soil consists of very fine particles of clay. Its water holding capacity is very high. Wet clay soil is very sticky. It contains very little air. The size of soil particles in clay  is less than 0.2mm. Clayey soil is rich in organic matter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8630" src="https://d1whtlypfis84e.cloudfront.net/guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/19080457/p24.png" alt="" width="430" height="233" /><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;"></span></em></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Suitable Crops: It is also not good for many plants. It is only good for crops like paddy, which require a lot of water. Clay is used for making toys, pots, and many other purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>3. Loamy Soil</strong></h3>
<p>The loamy soil consists of sand, clay,, and silt. It also contains enough hummus. It has a good water-holding capacity. It has sufficient aeration. It is well suited for cultivation. Roots of plants get enough water, air and space to grow.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8631" src="https://d1whtlypfis84e.cloudfront.net/guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/19080459/p32.png" alt="types of soil - loamy soil" width="419" height="279" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Suitable Crops: Loamy soil is ideal for growing crops such as wheat, sugarcane, cotton, jute, pulses, and oilseeds. Vegetables also grow well in this soil.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Soil Classification on the Based on Color</h2>
<h3><strong>1. Red soil</strong></h3>
<p>The red color of soil is due to the presence of iron oxide. It appears yellow when it contains less iron or more water. Red soil contains a mixture of clay and sand, antis not fertile. However, the soil can be fertile by adding manures and fertilizers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8632" src="https://d1whtlypfis84e.cloudfront.net/guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/19080501/p41.png" alt="types of soil - red soil" width="356" height="218" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Suitable Crops: It is suitable for growing groundnuts, pulses, millet, cotton and tobacco.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2. Black soil</strong></h3>
<p>Black soil is also known as <strong>black lava soil</strong>. This soil black in color. It is formed from lava rocks and is rich in clay.</p>
<h4><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8633" src="https://d1whtlypfis84e.cloudfront.net/guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/19080503/p51.png" alt="types of soil - black soil" width="272" height="204" /></h4>
<ul>
<li>Suitable Crops: It is ideal for growing crops such as cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, wheat, millets, and oilseeds.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><big>Red Soil</big></li><br>
<li><big>Black Soil</big></li><br>
</ul>
<p>On the basis of texture:</p>
<ul>
<li><big>Sandy Soil</big></li><br>
<li><big>Clayey Soil</big></li><br>
<li><big>Loamy Soil</big></li><br>
</ul>
<p><big>Properties of Soil</big></p>
<p>The upper layer of earth in which plants grow is called soil. It is black or dark brown material typically consisting of a mixture of organic remains, clay, and rock particles. The soil has the following special properties:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Texture</strong></h3>
<p>The texture of the soil depends upon the relative amount of these particles. Clay has the smallest sized particles. Because of very small size, the clay is felt smooth. Silt particles are larger than the clay particles. There size range from0.002 to 0.02mm in diameter. So silt does not feel smooth. Sand particles are largest sized particles of soil. Their diameter is more than0.02mm</p>
<ul>
<h3><strong>2. Absorption of water </strong></h3>
<p>Water holding capacity in different types of soils is different. Soil absorbs water because it is porous. Sandy soil holds less water than clay soil and loamy soil. Clay soil holds more water than sandy soil. Sand absorbs less water than clay. Some plants require more water to grow; they grow well in clay soil and loam soil, since sand hold less water, so less vegetation is found in sandy soil.</p>
<h4><strong>Activity</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Take three funnels and put some cotton wool in the mouth of each.</li>
<li>Put equal quantities of sandy, clayey and loamy soils in the funnels</li>
<li>Keep them in three bottles.</li>
<li>Pour equal quantities of water over them.</li>
<li>Observe quantity of water after some time?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Observation:</strong> Which bottle contains minimum water?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14207" style="text-align: center;" title="Properties of Soil" src="https://d1whtlypfis84e.cloudfront.net/guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/05092407/p13.png" alt="Properties of Soil" width="458" height="245" /></p>
<h3><strong>3. Moisture</strong></h3>
<p>Texture decides the water holding capacity of the soil. The soil has some amount of water inside it as a moisture. Water is usually present as a thin film around the soil particles. It is absorbed by the roots of the plants. The capacity of a soil to hold water is important for the growth of various crops.<em> Even a dry soil has some water in it.</em></p>
<h4><strong>Activity</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Collect some soil and put it in a container.</li>
<li>Cover the container with a lid and heat it.</li>
<li>Remove the lid after 5 min.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Observation:</strong> We will see that there are small droplets of water on the inner surface of the containers and lid. Where do these droplets come from?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14208" title="Properties of Soil" src="https://d1whtlypfis84e.cloudfront.net/guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/05092409/p22.png" alt="Properties of Soil" width="380" height="285" /></p>
<h3> 4<em>. </em><strong>Colour</strong></h3>
<p>Soils are of different colours. They are red white and black. The red colour of the soil is due to the presence of iron oxide. The black colour soil is rich in minerals and humus. It is good for the growth of wheat and jowar</p>
<h3><strong>5. Soil pH</strong></h3>
<p>Soil can be acid, alkaline or neutral. Some plants grow in acidic soil (pH below 7) such as potatoes and kumara. Carrots and lettuces prefer soil with neutral pH (7.0). Soil become more acidic over time as minerals are leached away.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Percolation Rate</strong></h3>
<p>When we sprinkle water on the ground, it is soon absorbed by the soil. This is because water percolates through the soil. The process in which water passes down slowly through the sol is called percolation of water.  But water does not percolate at the same rate in all types of soils.</p>
<p>Sandy soil allows maximum percolation of water and clay soil allows minimum percolation of water. Rainwater percolates through the soil and collects above the bedrock. This level of groundwater is called water table. Sandy soil is quite loose, so the percolation rate of water is highest in sandy soil but lowest in the clay soil because it is very compact.</p>
<p>Paddy (rice crops)is planted in standing water in the fields. Hence, the soil with a low percolation rate of water would be the most suitable for growing paddy because it will allow the water to remain in the fields for a much longer time.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Soil contains air</strong></h3>
<p>Air is present in the space between the soil particles. This air provides the oxygen required for respiration by roots of plants and other organisms. Sand particles are quite large. Sand particles cannot fit closely together, so there is large space between sand particles.</p>
<p>The large space between sand particles is filled with air. Due to this, sandy soil provides much more air to the plant root. But clay particles pack tightly together leaving little space for air. So, clayey soil provides much less air to the plant root which grows in it.</p>
<h4><strong>  Activity</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fill half a jar with dry garden soil and put it down.</li>
<li>Gently pour water on the soil until the jug is full.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Observation:</strong> We will observe that the water sinks in the soil. The water pushes out the air in spaces. The air comes up in bubbles which burst on the water surface. Therefore, we can say that soil contains air.</p>

<h2><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Formation of Soil</strong></span></h2>
<p>The soil has taken thousands of years to form. Soil formation takes place in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big rocks break down into smaller rocks by continuous action of wind and rain. It takes many years for these rocks to break down into smaller rocks.</li>
<li>Rocks are mainly broken by two types of weathering- physical weathering and chemical weathering. A number of natural force, called agents, work to break down the parent rock into tiny particles of soil. These agents include wind, water, the sun’s heat, and plants and animals.</li>
<li>These pieces get further broken down to form sand and silt and, ultimately, into finer particles and the process continues. This process is very slow. It takes thousands of years to form a just 1cm layer of soil. These fine particles form the top layer of the soil.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Soil Profile</strong></span></h2>
<p>The soil is found in layers, which are arranged during the formation of soil. These layers called horizons, the sequence of layers is the soil profile. The layers of soil can easily be observed by their color and size of particles. The main layers of the soil are <a href="https://www.toppr.com/guides/science/soil/soil-erosion/">topsoil</a>, subsoil and the parent rock. Each layer has its own characteristics.</p>
<p>These features of the layer of soil play a very important role in determining the use of the soil. Soil that has developed three layers, is mature soil. It takes many years under a favorable condition for the soil to develop its three layers. At some places, the soil contains only two layers. Such soil is immature soil.</p>
<h2><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 18pt;">Horizons of the Soil</span></h2>
<p>Soil consists of the following horizons:</p>
<h3>1. Horizon A or Topsoil</h3>
<p>It is also called the humus layer, which is rich in organic material. This layer consists of decomposed material and organic matter. This is the reason, the topsoil has a dark brown color. The hummus makes the topsoil soft, porous to hold enough air and water. In this layer, the seeds germinate and roots of the plants grow. Many living organisms like earthworms, millipedes, and centipedes, bacteria, and fungi are found in this layer of soil.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>What are the different Properties of Soil?</a></em></p>
<h3>2. Horizon B or Subsoil</h3>
<p>Just below the topsoil lies another layer called subsoil or horizon-B. It is comparatively harder and compact than topsoil. It is lighter in color than the topsoil because there is less humus in this layer. This layer is less organic but is rich in minerals brought down from the topsoil. It contains metal salts, especially iron oxide in a large proportion. Farmers often mix horizon-A and horizon-B when ploughing their fields.</p>
<h3>3. Bedrock or Horizon C</h3>
<p>Bedrock is also known as parent rock and lies just below the subsoil. It contains no organic matter and made up of stones and rocks, so it is very hard. This layer represents a transition zone between the earth’s bedrock and horizon A and B.</p>
